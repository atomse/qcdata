 ZORA relativistic basis sets for the use with the molecular adf-program:

   SZ:   ZORA relativistic single zeta
   DZ:   ZORA relativistic double zeta
   DZP:  ZORA relativistic double zeta + 1 polarization function
   TZP:  ZORA relativistic valence triple zeta + 1 polarization function
   TZ2P: ZORA relativistic valence triple zeta + 2 polarization function
   TZ2P+: ZORA relativistic for transition metals Sc-Zn and lanthanides only:
          as TZ2P, extra d-STO (3d metals), extra f-STO (lanthanides)
   QZ4P: ZORA relativistic valence quadruple zeta + 4 polarization function


 For standard calculations (energies, geometries, etc.) we recommend the
 following hierarchy of basis sets:

 SZ < DZ < DZP < TZP < TZ2P < TZ2P+ < ../ET/ET-pVQZ < QZ4P

 where the largest and most accurate basis is on the right.
 Not all basis sets are available for all elements. Some basis sets
 do not contain frozen-core basis sets.

 DZ and DZP are reasonable default basis sets for time-consuming
 calculations on large systems for which medium accuracy is sufficient.

 TZP, TZ2P, and TZ2P+ are good default basis sets for high accuracy
 on medium-sized and small systems.

 ../ET/ET-pVQZ and QZ4P are very large basis sets for cases where
 basis set limit accuracy is needed, or for small systems where CPU
 time is not a concern.

Basis set description SZ, DZ, DZP, TZP, TZ2P, TZ2P+, QZ4P:
 Comparison of the sizes of the ZORA basis sets.
 Warning: this table is not exact in all cases.
 Warning: sometimes increasing the basis set from TZP
          to TZ2P will not always give you extra basis functions
          (especially for most lanthanide and actinide frozen
           core basis sets)

 The all electron SZ basis sets all are single zeta in the core,
 the all electron DZ, DZP, TZP, and TZ2P basis sets all are double zeta in
 the core, and the all electron QZ4P basis sets are triple zeta in the core.
 In the valence region the SZ basis sets are single zeta, the DZ and DZP
 basis sets are double zeta, the TZP and TZ2P basis sets are triple zeta,
 and the QZ4P basis set are quadruple zeta.
 The Table shows under the header `valence orbitals' the occupied orbitals
 which are considered to be in the valence region and which are fitted with
 one (SZ), two (DZ), three (TZ), or four (QZ) STOs.
 This list of valence orbitals should not be used as the definition of
 valence orbitals, it is made here only for convenience.
 The Table also shows under the header of the name of the basis sets
 the number of extra functions of s, p, d or f type STOs that are
 included in the basis sets.
 These functions can be either polarization functions or (somewhat) diffuse
 functions, which are included mostly for a better description of molecular
 orbitals.
 Frozen core basis set are also available in the SZ, DZ, DZP, TZP, TZ2P directories.
 In the valence region these basis sets are the same as the corresponding
 all electron basis sets.
 In the core region one core orthogonalization function, a Slater-type
 function (STO), per frozen core orbital is used to orthogonalize
 the basis function on the accurately calculated core orbitals,
 coming from atomic calculations.
 The SZ basis sets are available for the elements H-Kr (Z=1-36).
 The DZP basis sets are available for the elements H-Ca, Ga-Kr (Z=1-20,Z=31-36).
 The DZ, TZP, TZ2P, and QZ4P basis sets are available for the
 elements H-E118 (Z=1-118).
 The TZ2P+ basis is available for elements Sc-Zn (Z=21-30).
 
 Especially for the elements H-Kr (Z=1-36) one can find large basis sets
 in the ../ET (even tempered) directory.

 Warning: one should not use frozen core non-relativistic basis sets in ZORA calculations.


*******************************************************************************

The standard basis sets have been updated in ADF2002.02 and have changed
their names.

 -------------------
 Old name | New name
 -------------------
 I        | SZ
 II       | DZ
 III      | DZP
 IV       | TZP
 V        | TZ2P
 -------------------

The fit sets of the all electron basis sets of Li and Be
have been improved in ADF2002.03 for
the directories DZ, DZP, TZP, and TZ2P
