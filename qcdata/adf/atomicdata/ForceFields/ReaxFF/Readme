Description of ReaxFF force fields
==================================

Disclaimer:  Using these forcefields for systems they have not been explicitly trained against
may produce unrealistic results. Please see the full manuscripts for more detailed information.

The force field files used by the SCM version of ReaxFF are compatible with those used by the 
original ReaxFF code. So if you have the force field information from somewhere else you can 
just use it (save it in a text file, and select it in ADFinput via the Other... option).


AB.ff: (H/O/N/B) Ammonia Borane

    http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp100136c
    - QM data were generated describing the single and (if relevant) double and triple bond 
        dissociation for all B/N/O/H combinations. These data were used to derive initial 
        ReaxFF bond parameters, and all calculations were performed using DFT with the B3LYP
        functional and the Pople 6-311G** basis set.
    - The training set was then extended with QM data describing angular distortions in a set
        of small AB-related (AB = H3N-BH3) molecules. These data were used to derive the 
        initial ReaxFF angular parameters.
    - The training set was extended with reaction barriers for key reaction steps such as H2 
        release from AB, dimerization of H2B-NH2 and reaction energies associated with H2 
        release from AB and with AB oxidation.

    - To obtain the H/C/O compound data required to extend the hydrocarbon-training set, 
        DFT calculations were performed on the following systems: (a) dissociation energies
        for various bonds containing carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen.  The ground state structure
        was obtained through full geometry optimization.  Dissociation curves were calculated
        by constraining only the bond length of interest and re-optimization of the remaining
        internal coordinates. Optimization was also performed for the various angles and 
        torsions associated with C/H/O interactions.

        complex physicochemical processes, such as the oxide-ion diffusion, fuel conversion, 
        water formation reaction, coking, and delamination, occurring at the TPB and can be 
        recommended for further computational studies of the fuel/electrode/electrolyte
