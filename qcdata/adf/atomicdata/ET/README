Short description of ET basis sets, devised by Del Chong.

 ET-pVQZ: latest (and best) ET basis set of quadruple zeta quality. It gives
          lower basis set superposition errors than ET-QZ3P and ET-QZ+5P
          due to a better description of the atoms. It is to be preferred 
          over ET-QZ3P and ET-QZ+5P for this reason.
 ET-QZ3P: non-relativistic valence quadruple zeta basis set + 3 polarization functions
 ET-QZ3P-1DIFFUSE: basis set ET-QZ3P + 1 set of diffuse s,p,d,and f STOs
 ET-QZ3P-2DIFFUSE: basis set ET-QZ3P + 2 sets of diffuse s,p,d,and f STOs
 ET-QZ3P-3DIFFUSE: basis set ET-QZ3P + 3 sets of diffuse s,p,d,and f STOs
 ET-QZ+5P: similar to basis set ET-QZ3P only 5 polarization functions instead of 3,
           + 1 set of tight s, p, etc STOs (if there is an occupied s, p, etc level)
           + 1 set of diffuse s, p, etc STOs (if there is an occupied s, p, etc level)
            

More extensive basis set description:
 Even tempered all electron basis sets.
 Normal (nonrelativistic) basis and fit sets consist only of 1S, 2P, 3D, etc. functions 
 For each l-value the exponents are defined by n, alpha, and beta
 according to exponent = alpha * beta^i, for i = 1 up to n 
 In these basis sets (except ET-pVQZ) always beta = 1.7 is chosen.
 for example basis sets sizes for oxygen:
  ET-pVQZ:          6S 4P 2D 1F even-tempered basis for O
  ET-QZ3P:          6S 4P 2D 1F even-tempered basis for O
  ET-QZ3P-1DIFFUSE: 7S 5P 3D 2F even-tempered basis for O
  ET-QZ3P-2DIFFUSE: 8S 6P 4D 3F even-tempered basis for O
  ET-QZ3P-3DIFFUSE: 9S 7P 5D 4F even-tempered basis for O
  ET-QZ+5P:         8S 6P 3D 2F even-tempered basis for O
   
Further comment: 
For standard calculations (energies, geometries, etc.) we recommend the
following hierarchy of basis sets:

SZ < DZ < DZP < TZP < TZ2P < TZ2P+ < ET/ET-pVQZ < ZORA/QZ4P

where the largest and most accurate basis is on the right. 
Not all basis sets are available for all elements. Some basis sets
do not contain frozen-core basis sets.

For special calculations requiring diffuse functions, the DIFFUSE
basis sets provided here may be of use in some cases.
