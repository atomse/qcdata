   TZ2P+:   For transition metals Sc-Zn and lanthanides (ZORA) only: 
            as TZ2P, but with extra d-STO (3d metals), and extra f-STO (lanthanides, ZORA)

            negatively charged small molecules
            ASZ, ADZ, ADZP, ATZP, ATZ2P
   
   OLD: obsolete basis sets, for historical reasons and reproducibility of old ADF results
   Special: special non-relativistic basis sets, see Special/README (AE, MDC, Vdiff, Bunge)


General advise:
===============

 For standard calculations (energies, geometries, etc.)
 we recommend the following hierarchy of basis sets:

 SZ < DZ < DZP < TZP < TZ2P < TZ2P+ < ET/ET-pVQZ < ZORA/QZ4P,

 Here the largest and most accurate basis is on the right.
 Not all basis sets are available for all elements. 
 Some basis sets do not contain frozen-core basis sets.

 DZ and DZP are reasonable default basis sets for time-consuming calculations 
 on large systems for which medium accuracy is sufficient.

 TZP, TZ2P, and TZ2P+ are good default basis sets for high accuracy 
 on medium-sized and small systems.

 ET/ET-pVQZ and ZORA/QZ4P are very large basis sets,
 for cases where basis set limit accuracy is needed, 
 or for small systems where CPU time is not a concern.

 AUG basis sets are reasonably optimal basis sets for TDDDFT calculations.

 For small negatively charged atoms or molecules, like F^- or OH^-
 one needs extra diffuse functions in the basis set,
 which are present in AUG, ET/ET-QZ3P-1DIFFUSE, ET-QZ3P-2DIFFUSE, or ET-QZ3P-3DIFFUSE basis sets.

 The all electron SZ basis sets all are single zeta in the core,
 and the all electron DZ, DZP, TZP, and TZ2P basis sets all are double zeta in the core.

 In the valence region the SZ basis sets are single zeta, the DZ and DZP
 basis sets are double zeta, the TZP and TZ2P basis sets are triple zeta.

 The Table shows under the header `valence orbitals' the occupied orbitals
 which are considered to be in the valence region and which are fitted with
 one (SZ), two (DZ), or three (TZ) STOs.  
 This list of valence orbitals should not be used as the definition of
 valence orbitals, it is made here only for convenience.

 The Table also shows under the header of the name of the basis sets
 the number of extra functions of s, p, d or f type STOs that are
 included in the basis sets.
 These functions can be either polarization functions or (somewhat) diffuse
 functions, which are included mostly for a better description of molecular
 orbitals.

 Frozen core basis set are also available in the SZ, DZ, DZP, TZP, and TZ2P directories.
 In the valence region these basis sets are the same as the corresponding all electron basis sets.
 In the core region one core orthogonalization function, a Slater-type
 function (STO), per frozen core orbital is used to orthogonalize
 the basis function on the accurately calculated core orbitals,
 coming from atomic calculations.

 The SZ and TZ2P basis sets are available for the elements H-Kr (Z=1-36).
 The DZP basis sets are available for the elements H-Ca, Ga-Kr (Z=1-20,Z=31-36).
 The DZ and TZP basis sets are available for the elements H-Lr (Z=1-103).
 All electron basis sets are available only for the elements H-Kr (Z=1-36).
 The TZ2P+ basis is available for elements Sc-Zn (Z=21-30). 

 Especially for the elements H-Kr (Z=1-36) one can find large basis sets in the ET directory.
 In the ZORA directory one can find all-electron basis sets also for elements heavier than Z=37, 
 which can also be used in non-relativistic calculations.

 Warning: one should **NOT** use frozen core ZORA basis sets in non-relativistic calculations.

 In the ZORA directory one can also find all electron basis sets of valence quadruple zeta quality. 
 These all-electron basis sets can also be used in non-relativistic calculations.

 II       | DZ
 III      | DZP
 IV       | TZP
 V        | TZ2P
 -------------------
 AE is moved to Special/AE
 Vdiff is moved to Special/Vdiff

The fit sets of the all electron basis sets of Li and Be
have been improved in ADF2002.03 for
the directories DZ, DZP, TZP, and TZ2P
